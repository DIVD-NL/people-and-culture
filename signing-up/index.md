# Thank you for signing up!

We are absolutely thrilled to welcome you as a volunteer!
Your decision to contribute your time and skills to our community is highly appreciated. 

At DIVD, we are experiencing an exciting period of growth, with numerous dedicated individuals like yourself joining our ranks. To smoothen the onboarding journey, please read below carefuly. 

## How does the process looks like

1. To confirm your identity
We kindly request you to complete and submit a certificate of conduct (VOG). Shortly you will receive an invitation by  @justis.nl to submit a **free** (no costs will be charged). More info can be found here https://www.justis.nl/en/products/certificate-of-conduct).

Please note the processing of a code of conduct can from 2 weeks up to months depending on your municipality, nationality and/or ... don't worry. 
Once you receive it via mail, please **take a photo of the paper document or upload the PDF [here](https://form.jotform.com/241683944130355)**. 

_After we have [validated](https://validatie.nl/) your certificate, we will delete the photo or PDF file, in line with our privacy policy_. 

2. After the completion of certificate of conduct, plan an introductory call
Additionally, you have to book an introductory meeting to further familiarize yourself with our organization. You can schedule this meeting at your convenience via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/victor-gevers/divd-introductory-meeting). To prepare for the interview we highly recommend that you take our brief introductory course available at [DIVD Introduction](https://divd.thinkific.com/courses/DIVD-Introduction).

3. Sign a volunteer agreement
Upon completion of the preceding steps, you will be required to sign a volunteer agreement. This agreement affirms your commitment to adhere to the [DIVD Code of Conduct](https://www.divd.nl/what-we-do/code-of-conduct/). By signing, you acknowledge and agree to uphold the standards and principles outlined in this code, ensuring that your conduct aligns with the values and expectations set forth by DIVD.

Please be aware that the onboarding process, including the necessary screening, may take some time (it can range from 2 weeks up to between one and four months). However, during this period, you are more than welcome to actively interact with other volunteers on the [DIVD.community](https://DIVD.community) Slack. This is a great way to start integrating into our community and begin making valuable connections. 

**Thank you for your enthusiasm and commitment to our cause.**
We look forward to your active participation and are excited about the contributions you will bring to DIVD.
