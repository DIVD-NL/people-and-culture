# Thank you for signing up!

We are absolutely thrilled to welcome you as a volunteer! 
Your decision to contribute your time and skills to our community is highly appreciated. 

At DIVD, we are experiencing an exciting period of growth, with numerous dedicated individuals like yourself joining our ranks. 
As a result of this influx, we are currently in the process of reviewing your application.

While we diligently process your application, we warmly invite you to immerse yourself in our vibrant community at [DIVD.community](https://DIVD.community). 
This platform is an excellent resource for connecting with fellow volunteers and engaging with the dynamic and supportive environment that makes DIVD unique.

## How does the process looks like

To give you a comprehensive understanding of our work and mission at DIVD, we highly recommend that you take our brief introductory course available at [DIVD Introduction](https://divd.thinkific.com/courses/DIVD-Introduction). 
This course will provide you with valuable insights and, upon completion, you will automatically receive an invitation for a **free** (no costs will be charged) [Certficate of Conduct](https://www.justis.nl/en/products/certificate-of-conduct) **to confirm your identity**. 
Once you receive it via email, please **take a photo of the paper document or upload to the PDF [here](https://form.jotform.com/241683944130355). _After we have [validated](https://validatie.nl/) your certificate, we will securely delete the photo or PDF file._

Additionally, we encourage you to book an introductory meeting to further familiarize yourself with our organization. 
You can schedule this meeting at your convenience via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/victor-gevers/divd-introductory-meeting).

Please be aware that the onboarding process, including the necessary screening, may take some time (between one and four months). 
However, during this period, you are more than welcome to actively interact with other volunteers on the [DIVD.community](https://DIVD.community) Slack. 
This is a great way to start integrating into our community and begin making valuable connections. 

** Thank you for your enthusiasm and commitment to our cause. **
We look forward to your active participation and are excited about the contributions you will bring to DIVD.
