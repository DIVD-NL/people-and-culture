# Thank you for signing up!

We are thrilled to welcome you as a volunteer! 
Your decision to contribute your time and skills to our community is highly appreciated. 

At DIVD, we are experiencing an exciting period of growth, with numerous dedicated individuals like yourself joining our ranks. 
As a result of this influx, we are currently reviewing your application.

While we are diligently processing your application, we would like to invite you to immerse yourself in our vibrant community at [DIVD.community](https://DIVD.community). 
This platform is an excellent resource for connecting with fellow volunteers and engaging with the dynamic and supportive environment that makes DIVD unique.

## How does the process look like

To give you a comprehensive understanding of DIVD's work and mission, we highly recommend that you take our brief introductory course, which is available at [DIVD Introduction](https://divd.thinkific.com/courses/DIVD-Introduction).
This course will provide you with valuable insights. Upon completion, you will automatically receive an invitation for a **free** (no costs will be charged) [Certificate of Conduct](https://www.justis.nl/en/products/certificate-of-conduct) **to confirm your identity**. 

Once you receive it via email, please **take a photo of the paper document or upload it to the PDF [here](https://form.jotform.com/241683944130355)**. _After we have [validated](https://validatie.nl/) your certificate, we will delete the photo or PDF file._

Also, you'll need to book an introductory meeting to familiarize yourself with our organization further. 
You can schedule this meeting at your convenience via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/victor-gevers/divd-introductory-meeting).

After completing the following steps, you must sign a volunteer agreement. This agreement confirms that you are committed to following the [DIVD Code of Conduct](https://www.divd.nl/what-we-do/code-of-conduct/). By signing, you will acknowledge and agree to maintain the standards and principles outlined in this code, ensuring that your conduct matches the values and expectations set forth by DIVD.

Please be aware that the onboarding process, including the necessary screening, may take some time (between one and four months). 
However, during this period, you can actively interact with other volunteers in the [DIVD.community](https://DIVD.community) Slack. 
This is a great way to integrate into our community and make valuable connections. 

**Thank you for your enthusiasm and commitment to our cause.**
We look forward to your active participation and your contributions to DIVD.
