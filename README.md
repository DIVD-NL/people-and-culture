# People & Culture
Formerly known as Human Resources (HR).

## Introduction
The People & Culture team is dedicated to fostering a supportive and engaging environment for our volunteers. Our responsibilities encompass the entire volunteer lifecycle, including onboarding, offboarding, training, and coaching. Additionally, we manage volunteer administration tasks such as drafting volunteer agreements, defining functional levels, and maintaining the organizational hierarchy.

We also play a crucial advisory role, providing guidance to managers and team leaders to ensure that everyone involved with DIVD has a positive and fulfilling experience. To further support our volunteers, we have established a coaching structure that offers non-hierarchical support to anyone seeking mentorship. Our team not only coordinates the coaching program but also provides guidance to the coaches themselves, thereby promoting a culture of continuous learning and development within DIVD.
